# Welcome! 
I'm Brian Ju, a computer science student at the University of Maryland and incoming software engineer. 

Here's some insight into my ongoing professional, academic, and personal life:

*☝️ Prior to Google, I interned at Amazon 🍌, Capital One 🏛 and Stryker Medical 🩺

*🏋️‍♂️I enjoy staying active, and am interested in many different sports! Feel free to ask me about any.
